# Euman Scanner

## Formal Methods for Security Gate Patterns

📄 [Read the full paper (PDF)](./Security_Gate_Formal_Methods.pdf)
```

Just commit the PDF alongside the README in the repo root.

**Option 2 — Use the markdown version as your README**

Rename the content to `README.md` directly so it *is* the index. The math symbols all render fine in GitHub-flavored markdown. The downside is you lose the typeset quality of the PDF.

**Option 3 — Both**

Keep `README.md` as a short intro with the PDF link, and also include the `.md` version as a separate file for people who prefer reading in-browser without the PDF viewer.

For your repo structure it'd look something like:
```
euman-scanner/
├── README.md                          ← landing page, links to PDF
├── Security_Gate_Formal_Methods.pdf   ← the typeset document
